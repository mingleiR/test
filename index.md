Multi-omics technologies have brought about a great advance in discovering microbial dark matter. However, how to utilize  metagenomic datasets to gain insight into the adaptive strategies based on along environmental gradients is still a limited and ambiguous step in the field of microbial ecology. Here, we developed a functional trait-based analytic framework, which integrates the abundance of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and community-weighted mean of functional genes to pinpoint the functional traits which covary with environmental gradients and improve our ability to understand the mechanisms driving microbial adaptation.
