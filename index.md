## 1. Sequence analysis

1. Filter and trim metagenomic reads

1-1. detect the potential adapter and contamination


```
fastq_f=$1
cores=$2

## reading fastq file in the command
fastqc --format fastq  --extract --threads $cores ${fastq_f}
```


1-2. trim the adapter and cotamination


```
sample="$1"
cores="$2"

r1=${sample}_1.fastq.gz
r2=${sample}_2.fastq.gz

# minimum length for trimmed reads (50 is okay for assembly; 100 for SNP identification)
min_len_thresh=50
# quality for a sliding window of 4 bases
quality_thresh=25

## Welcome to GitHub Pages test [test]

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mingleiR/test/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mingleiR/test/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
